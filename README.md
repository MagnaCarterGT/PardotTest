# PardotTest

Hello, Pardot team! This code solves the secret. It can be run from command line or from your favorite IDE.


Feel free to modify SecretKeeper.secret(int) as you see fit, as long as it, you know, returns an int.


There's no fancy build here if you decide to run from the command line; a simple "java TestSecretKeeper [input]" will do the job (I've already provided the initially compiled classes). If/when you modify secret() remember to recompile with "javac *.java" before re-running with the new code.

Otherwise, you can run TestSecretKeeper from your IDE.

If you have any questions/comments/concerns/complaints, please email me at ctempleton89@gmail.com. Thanks!
