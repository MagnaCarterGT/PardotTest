# PardotTest

Hello, Pardot team! This code solves the secret. It can be run from command line or from your favorite IDE. There's no fancy build here; a simple "java TestSecretKeeper [int input]" will do the job. If a number is not supplied by the user the program will randomly generate its own and proceed forward.

Feel free to modify SecretKeeper.secret(int) as you see fit. Just make sure it returns an int!
